# Streamlit: Dashboards and Web Apps in Python for Everyone

In this session, you'll be introduced to Streamlit, an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create interactive web applications and dashboards with minimal coding.

We'll cover the basics of Streamlit, including how to build simple data visualizations and interactive components like sliders and buttons. By the end of the workshop, you'll have the practical skills to create compelling visualizations and interfaces that bring your research, coursework, or administrative tasks to life. We look forward to seeing you there!



## Getting started
